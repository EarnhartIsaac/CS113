a)
	displayed n^2 times so this is an O(n^2) function for T(n), c is 1, n is 0
b) 
	displayed 2n times so this is an O(n) function for T(n), c is 2,n is 0
c)
	0 5,0 4,0 3,0 2,0 1,0 0,1 5
	displayed n(n+1)/2 times so this is an O(n^2) for T(n), c is 1/2,n is 0 
d)
	I have no clue how to model this one
